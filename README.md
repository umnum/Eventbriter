## About Eventbriter

Eventbriter is a full stack web application that is inspired by the Eventbrite website. When users visit the site, they are allowed to view all the events that were created by Eventbriter members. A user can become an Eventbriter member by creating an account and signing in. Once a member is signed in, they have the ability to create their own events, update their events, and delete their events. If a user does not want to sign up for an account, they can log in as the Demo User which will allow them to explore the same features as a logged in user.

What separates Eventbriter from Eventbrite is that it is built as a single-page web application, which provides users with a dynamic and smooth navigation across the entire site. This was made possible by utilizing React and Redux on the frontend. The backend was built on a Ruby on Rails framework, while PostgreSQL was used for database storage along with Amazon AWS S3 to store the events' images.
